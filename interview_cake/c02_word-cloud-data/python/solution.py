"""
You want to build a word cloud, an infographic where the size of a word corresponds to how often it appears in the body of text.

To do this, you'll need data. Write code that takes a long string and builds its word cloud data in a dictionary, where the keys are words and the values are the number of times the words occurred.

Think about capitalized words.
Assume the input will only contain words and standard punctuation.
